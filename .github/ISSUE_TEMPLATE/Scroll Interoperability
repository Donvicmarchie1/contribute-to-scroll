Good Idea ! Interoperability protocols serve as the backbone for seamless communication and interaction among diverse systems, applications, and technologies. The current deployment of Scroll on platforms like Orbiter, Owlto, Rhino, Layerswap, and Layerzero is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. However, extending its deployment to other interoperability protocols like Axelar, Wormhole, and Jumper would significantly enhance its reach and utility.

By integrating Scroll with these protocols, a wide array of L1 and non-EVM blockchains such as Solana, NEAR, Fuse, Aptos, SEI, Oasis, and more could be interconnected. This expansion would not only facilitate easy accessibility but also accelerate the onboarding process, enabling smoother and faster interactions across various blockchain ecosystems. Such interoperability initiatives are pivotal for fostering innovation and driving the mainstream adoption of decentralized technologies.
